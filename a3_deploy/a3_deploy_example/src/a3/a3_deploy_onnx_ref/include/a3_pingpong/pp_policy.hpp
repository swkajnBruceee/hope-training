// Ping-pong policy front-end as a drop-in A3PolicyDriver CommandFn. Per tick:
//   scripted/planner racket target -> reference clock -> ONNX refs ->
//   180/177/175-D obs (auto-selected from the model input dim) ->
//   action -> target_q (Isaac) -> scatter to 31 SDK slots -> RobotCommand.
// NECK PASSIVE: head slots [3,4] are held at nominal, clamped into a bounded
// contract's current selected interval, with AGI's fixed PD (kp=40, kd=2);
// the model's neck outputs are ignored for hardware command.
//
// ===================== WHAT IS SCRIPTED vs LEARNED =====================
// The swing JOINT TRAJECTORY is NOT hard-coded. Every tick the learned ONNX
// policy emits a fresh 31-DOF action; q_des = default_q + action*action_scale.
// The forehand/backhand BODY POSTURE is learned (encoded in the policy weights +
// the baked reference clip the ONNX carries as obs-independent side-outputs).
//   LEARNED (ONNX, per tick):  31 joint actions -> q_des; kp/kd from metadata.
//   REFERENCE (ONNX side-out): command[0:62] ref joint_pos/vel + tracked body
//                              poses, indexed by time_step (the strike clock).
//   SCRIPTED (this file, C++):  the racket TARGET (pos/vel/normal-sign), the
//                              strike clock (time_to_strike -> time_step), and
//                              the forehand/backhand SELECT (swing_dir_). There
//                              is NO live ball tracker / planner -- ScriptedTarget
//                              is a fixed front-right TEST target. Pressing f/b
//                              only flips the target y-sign + swing_type and picks
//                              the matching baked clip; it does not load new poses.
//   OVERWRITTEN AFTER ONNX:    neck slots [3,4] forced passive; legs forced to
//                              nominal iff --legs-passive; q_des clamped to A3
//                              joint limits (safety). Nothing else is overridden.
// To hit REAL balls, replace ScriptedTarget with planner output (pos/vel/normal/
// hit-time from a ball-trajectory estimator); the policy/obs/decode stay as-is.
// ======================================================================
//
// Depends only on Eigen + onnxruntime + robot_io_backend.hpp (plain structs),
