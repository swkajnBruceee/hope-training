"""Python reference runner for the 110-D ``hitter_pure`` deploy contract.

This package implements the observation, action and RacketCommand contract. It
contains the executable simulation path and runs the exported policy against the
shipped MuJoCo sim.

Public modules:
  joint_order      -- the 31-DOF Agibot A3 joint order
  observation      -- the 110-D hitter_pure observation builder
  action_adapter   -- the shared ActionAdapter (raw_action -> joint targets)
  racket_command   -- RacketCommand + command sources
  ros_command_source -- ROS 2 planner bridge (/racket/command_flat -> source)
  lifecycle        -- ready -> swing -> follow-through -> recovery state machine
  onnx_policy      -- onnxruntime actor wrapper (obs[1,110] -> raw_action[1,31])
  sim_bridge       -- MuJoCo (default) and AimRT-process (seam) bridges
  config           -- runtime config loader
  runner           -- the 50 Hz control loop
