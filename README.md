# HOPE: Hitch Open Ping-Pong Embodied AI Challenge

HOPE is an open platform for humanoid robot table tennis, developed by [Hitch Interactive](https://hitchinteractive.com) (Intelligent Racing Inc.) in collaboration with the [ROAR Platform](https://roar.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley. The challenge invites teams to deploy whole-body humanoid controllers that can rally a ping-pong ball against human opponents or other robots, using off-the-shelf humanoid hardware and an open-source perception and planning stack.

This repository contains the **reference design documents** for the HOPE system architecture, a public **Agibot A3 + Isaac Lab starter**, and Agibot-provided A3 reference materials under `agibot/`. The starter is intended to get new teams from clone to asset load, table-tennis scene smoke test, and local-motion PPO smoke training.

## How To Read This Repository

Start with this README, then follow [QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md](QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md).
That is the only required path for the v1 public starter. The rest of the
repository is organized into four layers:

| Layer | What to read or run | Purpose |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| Required starter path | `QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md`, `hope_training/whole_body_tracking/scripts/prepare_a3_isaac_asset.py`, `agibot/URDF/A3T2.5-URDF-std-pingpang/`, `hope_training/whole_body_tracking/` | Prepare the A3 Isaac asset, import the task package, launch the table-tennis scene, and run local-motion PPO smoke training. |
| Stable public contracts | `A3_ASSETS.md`, `docs/interfaces/` | Explain frame conventions, joint order, observations/actions, ROS topics, and asset expectations that other teams should keep stable when integrating their own code. |
| Agibot A3 reference bundle | `agibot/` | Agibot-provided A3 URDF variants, MuJoCo/AimRT simulation reference, and deployment example. Only the racket-equipped URDF is required for the Isaac quickstart. |
| Optional or background material | `hope_ws/`, `data/mocap/`, `HOPE_*_Reference_Setup.md`, `ROADMAP.md` | Preserve broader HOPE architecture, ROS/mocap/planner context, and future work. These are not required before the Isaac smoke run. |

A fresh clone contains only tracked files. Developer-local folders such as
`external_repos/`, `vendor_assets/`, generated Isaac assets, logs, checkpoints,
and WandB caches are git-ignored. Agibot-provided materials under `agibot/` are
tracked. If you switch branches in an existing checkout and still see an ignored
local folder, that usually means it is an untracked folder left on disk; it is
not part of the tracked public starter contents.

For two-person or team development, keep machine-specific paths in ignored local
files and keep shared environment definitions in Git. See
[docs/dev_environment.md](docs/dev_environment.md),
[docs/development_workflow.md](docs/development_workflow.md), and
[docs/dependency_policy.md](docs/dependency_policy.md). Before merging, run:

```bash
./check.sh
```

## Public Starter Quickstart

Start here:

```bash
python3 hope_training/whole_body_tracking/scripts/prepare_a3_isaac_asset.py --force
cd hope_training/whole_body_tracking
source setup_train_env.sh
hope_isaac_py -c "import training.tasks; print('HOPE tasks import ok')"
hope_isaac_py scripts/play_table_tennis.py --headless --steps 300
hope_isaac_py scripts/create_smoke_motion.py --headless --frames 120 \
  --output sample_motions/agibot_a3_smoke_stand.npz
hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=TrackingFlat algo=ppo \
  headless=true logger=tensorboard \
  motion_file=sample_motions/agibot_a3_smoke_stand.npz \
  num_envs=32 max_iterations=3
```

See [QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md](QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md) for the full path. WandB is optional; the public smoke path uses a local `motion_file` and TensorBoard.

## Key Design Decisions

**Racket tracking is prohibited.** The motion capture system tracks exactly three categories of objects: the ping-pong table origin frame (PPT), each humanoid's `base_link` (P1, P2), and the ball. No reflective markers may be placed on the racket, the robot's hand, or the wrist link. Each robot must infer its paddle's 6-DOF pose through forward kinematics from its own `base_link` + joint encoders. This is a deliberate competition constraint that tests autonomous paddle control through the robot's internal body model.

**Multi-platform support.** The reference design documents discuss Unitree G1 and Agibot Expedition A3 paths. This public starter currently focuses on Agibot A3 in Isaac Lab for setup and smoke training. It also includes Agibot's A3 deployment and MuJoCo/AimRT reference materials for teams that want to study the body-drive interface or optional simulation path after exporting policies.

**Open-source training stack.** The WBC training pipeline is built entirely on open-source code: [BeyondMimic](https://github.com/HybridRobotics/whole_body_tracking) (MIT license) for motion tracking RL, [GMR](https://github.com/YanjieZe/GMR) (MIT license) for SMPL-X to robot retargeting, and [GVHMR](https://github.com/zju3dv/GVHMR) for monocular video-to-SMPL-X extraction. The HITTER paper's trained weights are not released; all training starts from scratch.

## Supported Robots

| Robot | DOF | Simulation Backend | Model Format | Status |
|-------|-----|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| Unitree G1 | 29 | Isaac Lab + PhysX | USD | Reference platform |
| Unitree G1 EDU | 29 + hands | Isaac Lab + PhysX | USD | Supported (hand DOFs unused) |
| Agibot Expedition A3 | 31 active joints in starter | Isaac Lab + PhysX smoke path; Agibot MuJoCo/AimRT reference included | URDF / MuJoCo reference assets | Public starter smoke path; optional deploy example included |

## Coordinate Frame Convention

All three documents share a common world frame (ROS 2 REP 103):

- **Origin**: Near-side left corner of the table surface
- **X**: Toward opponent (along the 2.74 m table length)
- **Y**: Left (along the 1.525 m table width)
- **Z**: Up
- **Table surface height**: 0.76 m above floor

The OptiTrack system must be configured with **Up Axis → Z** in Motive to match this convention.

## Prerequisites

The reference documents assume familiarity with:

- ROS 2 Jazzy
- Python 3.10+
- NVIDIA Isaac Lab 2.1.0 for the public starter
- OptiTrack Motive (or compatible motion capture system)
- PyTorch
- TensorBoard for the default public smoke run
- Weights & Biases (WandB), optional for registry-based motion loading or cloud logging
