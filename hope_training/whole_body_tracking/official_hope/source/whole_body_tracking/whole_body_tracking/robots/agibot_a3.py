"""Agibot (Zhiyuan) Expedition A3 — ping-pong configuration for whole-body tracking.

This file is written for the Agibot A3 ping-pong assets used by this workspace
(the URDF under ``agibot/URDF/A3T2.5-URDF-std-pingpang/`` and the MuJoCo MJCF
under ``a3_deploy/A3_MuJoCo_Sim/.../a3_pingpong/a3_pingpong.xml``).
Names, link inertials (urdf mass.txt), effort/velocity limits (joints.txt), joint armature, and the
standing pose are all taken from those files. The PD control gains (Kp/Kd = stiffness/damping
below) and the standing pose are the A3 deployment values used by this configuration
(``a3_deploy_onnx_ref/include/a3_policy_parameters.hpp`` — ``a3_kps`` / ``a3_kds`` / ``a3_default_angles``,
"a direct transcription of a3.py"). Head 40/2 is the deploy neck/head default (ExpandToBackend); the
2-DOF neck is not in the 29-DOF policy view.

Nothing here touches the filesystem at import time: ``ArticulationCfg`` only stores the asset
path string, so the A3 task registers and imports fine *without* the asset present. The path is
only resolved when an environment is actually instantiated for training.

A3 active DOF (31, excluding hands): waist yaw/roll/pitch (3), neck yaw/pitch (2),
each arm 7 (shoulder pitch/roll/yaw, elbow, wrist roll/pitch/yaw), each leg 6
(hip pitch/roll/yaw, knee, ankle pitch/roll). The right arm holds the paddle.

            # corrections barely move the plant (Gate 2.5 measured trk 9-32%) -> the policy
            # (trained on a frictionless plant) winds up and tips the robot in 3-5 s. Big swing
            # motions are barely affected (feedforward-dominated, trk 80-200%), which is why
            # Gate 2 / Gate 3 pass while the bare hold fails.

            # per-joint `damping`, 0.5-2.0 Nm·s/rad). Rationale: the deploy plants (AGI MuJoCo AND
            # the real drivetrain) apply the runner's message kd PLUS their own passive damping;
            # Isaac modeled only the message kd, so the policy trained on an under-damped plant —
            # measured on model_20200 via the 110-D mujoco_eval_onnx A/B: adding --keep-passive
            # alone took in-swing base-x excursion 0.066→0.084 mean / 0.121→0.464 max and racket
            # vel err 0.176→0.315, reproducing ~90% of the AGI-plant follow-through amplification
            # (explicit-Euler PD adds only the small remainder). Folding the passive term into the
            # implicit drive kd is exact for our command contract (dq_des ≡ 0, so kd·(0−qd) IS
            # viscous damping). THE EXPORT CONTRACT IS GUARDED: utils/exporter.py bakes the
            # DEPLOY message kd from A3_DEPLOY_JOINT_KD_PATTERNS below (NOT these raised training
            # values) — the plant adds its own passive damping, so baking the raised kd would

# The actuator `damping` values in A3_CFG are TRAINING-plant totals (message kd + MJCF passive
# viscous damping). The runner must SEND only the message kd (the plant adds its own passive
# damping), so utils/exporter.py bakes ONNX joint_damping from this table instead of
# data.default_joint_damping. The invariant  training_damping == deploy_kd + passive  is asserted
# PER JOINT at export time (utils/exporter.py resolves both tables via a3_deploy_joint_kd +
# a3_passive_joint_damping and raises on any mismatch; 2026-07-09 audit — this line previously
# CLAIMED a tests/exporter assertion that did not exist, and the exporter fell back SILENTLY to
# baking the raised training kd = double damping on the robot). Retune the three tables TOGETHER:
