"""Agibot A3 — HOPE ping-pong WBC (BeyondMimic + HITTER racket-target tracking).

This is the step-13 environment. It extends the A3 motion-tracking baseline
(:class:`AgibotA3FlatEnvCfg`) with the HITTER racket objective:

* a :class:`RacketTargetCommand` that samples the desired racket state (position/velocity/normal)
  and desired base XY each swing, and computes the actual racket state by FK through ``T_mount``;
* HOPE actor observations (desired racket pos rel-base, desired racket vel/normal world,
  time-to-strike, desired base XY rel-base) plus projected gravity, with privileged actual racket
  state on the critic;
* HITTER goal rewards (base-position before strike; racket pos/vel/normal in a window around strike),
  on top of the BeyondMimic imitation reward and the regularization reward;
* extended domain randomization for sim-to-real.

Default usage trains one unified forehand+backhand policy by passing two reference clips
(``registry_name`` + ``registry_name_2``). The swing-type observation is present on the actor so
one policy can condition on which clip/target family it is currently imitating.

# deploy-parity variant — deploy-honest observation (no fabricated base pose).

# WHY: the `full` actor obs above depends on the robot's true world base pose through three terms
# (motion_anchor_pos_b, base_target_pos_b, racket_target_pos_b). The mocap streams the base pose at
# 300 Hz during play, but that link is not bridged into the deploy front-end, so those terms are
# fabricated at deploy (anchor_pos_b := 0, base_pos := nominal) -> the deployed policy
# sees a DIFFERENT observation distribution than training and the legs cannot balance. Making the
# actor base-position-free is a deliberate robustness choice (no mocap/VRPN dependency). AGI's reference
# policy transfers because its observation is real-sensor-only (IMU orientation + proprioception, no
# world base position). This variant copies that recipe for the HOPE actor. The privileged CRITIC
# group is unchanged (it may use base pose in sim — it is never deployed). The `full` cfgs above are

# HITTER-footwork variant (arXiv:2508.21043 §V-B-1 "Separate Commands for Base and Racket") —
# deploy-parity base + the base-position command channel restored (2026-07-05).
#
# WHY: the BASE-FREE deploy-parity policy self-selects walk-and-strike footwork toward deep
# world-frame racket targets ("chasing a point forward"); it cannot be commanded to a station.
# HITTER instead (a) commands the base to a world XY station, (b) fixes the striking plane
# RELATIVE to the robot (0.4 m in front on their G1; our analog = each clip's reference
# base→racket strike offset), sampling only the racket target's y/z spread, and (c) activates
# base tracking only PRE-STRIKE (mdp.base_position_tracking_exp is already gated that way).
#
# SIM2REAL CONTRACT (177-D actor = 175-D deploy-parity + base_target_pos_b(2) restored at its
# original slot between projected_gravity and racket_target_pos_b):
#   * base_target_pos_b is a RELATIVE Δxy in the yaw-heading frame — computable on hardware from
#     the mocap base position (300 Hz, position-only; hope-mocap-spec) + IMU yaw-align-at-engage.
#     No absolute world coordinates enter the obs; mocap dropout → feed Δ=0, which degrades
#     gracefully to "already at station" (today's BASE-FREE behavior).
#   * A1 target latency/jitter does NOT yet degrade the base channel (the racket channel does);
#     the base station demand is O(10 cm), obs Unoise covers mocap noise. Revisit if hardware
#     shows base-channel transport lag matters.
#   * The C++ runner (pp_policy.hpp build_obs_175) and mujoco_eval_onnx are 175-D and need the
#     177-D layout + a planner base-target input before this variant can deploy — verify with
#     scripts/verify_realsensor.py layout print after any obs change.

# stands on hardware but swings on ~1/10 served balls and misses — the trained distribution is
# clip-centered and narrow, the actor carries the 62-D reference stream (paper: CRITIC-only,
# Table I), and the face-normal target was locked to the reference clip (paper §IV-C: the racket
# plane is PERPENDICULAR TO ITS VELOCITY at impact). This variant re-aligns all three.
#
# vs the paper (arXiv:2508.21043), EXACT alignment:
#   * Actor obs = Table I structure sized for the A3 (110-D): ang vel, gravity, e_base,x,
#     Δbase target (world xy), racket target rel base (world), racket target vel (world),
#     time-to-strike, q/q̇/a_last. NO reference joints, NO swing_type, NO anchor terms.
#   * Separate commands (§V-B-1): base station sampled INDEPENDENTLY (paper Fig. 4: up to
#     ±0.75-0.8 m, 1 cm arrival in <0.8 s); racket target on a plane FIXED relative to the
#     commanded station (their 0.4 m on the G1; our A3 analog = the clips' blade reach 0.70 m),
#     only y/z sampled, per-swing-type non-overlapping regions.
#   * Normal target = velocity direction (§IV-C impact model) — the policy must LEARN the wrist
#     orientation (initial error 18-110°; expected to learn slowly, do NOT "fix" it by moving
#     the target back to the reference normal — that is how legal returns became 0%).
#   * Reward = dense upper-body imitation + sparse goal (racket pos/vel/normal in the strike
#     window; base position pre-strike only) + generic regularization. NO hold_ready, NO foot/
#     stability shaping, NO HER replay, NO base_decel (paper has none of them).
#   * 10 s episodes, multiple swings, swing type + targets resampled per swing, no hold phase.
#
# Deliberate departures (kept, with reasons):
#   * stand_start_prob 0.25 + no-teleport wraps (deploy-honest entry/transition; paper does not
#     document its reset scheme).
#   * DR keeps PD ±15% / link mass ±15% (sim2real; paper fixes PD).
#   * Tuned kernel widths from the 0625-0706 lineage (paper publishes no weights/stds).

    boxes, DR, terminations, NO hold machinery) is byte-identical to plain HitterPure, so a HitterPure
    checkpoint warm-resumes STRICTLY. Two reward-side departures, both PRE-STRIKE base shaping:

    1. base_station_settle (base→station deceleration) — teaches the robot to move to the y-station EARLY
       and SETTLE there BEFORE the strike, instead of the last-moment rush that arrives hot and lunges.
       "Move fast when far, calm when at the station" (see hope_rewards.base_station_settle); the linear
       v_des gradient is alive across the whole ±0.40 band, unlike base_position's dead far edge. It never
       pays for freezing far away, so the y-footwork is DIRECTED, not suppressed.

    2. base_position_std 0.20 → 0.35 — a live station pull across the WHOLE ±0.40 band (at std 0.20 the
       kernel is gradient-dead at a fresh 0.40 m station, ``exp(-4)≈0.018``, so far y-stations exert
       almost no early pull). Trades some fine-arrival precision for the early-move gradient — acceptable
       until we chase the paper's 1 cm arrival; pairs with base_station_settle.

    ⚠ NO lower_body_plant_imitation. The demo leg-POSE plant was REMOVED (2026-07-09 A/B, memory
    hope-legplant-regresses-agi): tracking the demo's leg-joint pose at strike re-imports the demo's
    forward step-INTO-the-ball; Isaac hides it (G1 passes) but the AGI explicit-PD plant amplifies it into
    accumulating station drift → topple (model_22200_legplant fell AGI G3 ×2; the no-plant control
    model_21500_pldamp = 0 falls/12). It is FUNDAMENTALLY at odds with the x-lock intent; not a tuning
    problem. If the in-swing flail ever needs quieting, penalize leg-joint VELOCITY near strike (no
    forward-step-in bias), NOT the pose. base_station_settle above is the "RIGHT direction" (reduces drift).

    NOTE (moving-gait toe-in): the SEPARATE "移动时脚姿势不正常" pigeon-toe pathology (hip_yaw p95 0.94 rad)
    is still NOT addressed (its fix is ``foot_orientation_weight=-0.3``, 177-proven — enable on a resume).

    GATE ON AGI G3 (pp_gate3_rally.sh — FALLS, not just Isaac G1): the plant negative result showed G1

    """V2 + a TRAINED "arrive → hold/settle → strike" rhythm (2026-07-09). V2's reward shaping only
    biases the base to arrive EARLY/CALM inside a fixed, clip-driven pre-strike window ("don't rush at
    the last moment") — it cannot make the swing WAIT for arrival, because the strike clock is the demo
    clip phase (hope_commands: ``time_to_strike = (strike_step − motion.time_steps)·dt``), not an arrival
    condition. This variant adds the ONLY machinery that makes the wait a real TRAINED state: a HOLD at
    every clip wrap (+ reset) that freezes ``tts`` POSITIVE at the windup while the base settles at the
    NEXT station, then arms the swing. That frozen-positive-tts hold is exactly the deploy runner's
    idle/wait clamp (the swing clock is generated robot-side at deploy — hope_commands note), so the
    policy learns to behave during the runner's "wait" instead of only generalizing to it.

    Structure per cycle: swing → wrap (resample station/target/clip) → HOLD 0.5-2.5 s (base moves to the
    new station via base_station_settle + base_position, and SETTLES via hold_ready) → windup → swing.
    (Inherits V2's approach shaping = base_station_settle + widened base_position std; NO plant — the demo
    leg-POSE plant was dropped, see the V2 docstring / memory hope-legplant-regresses-agi.)

    Departures from V2 (all reuse existing machinery — obs/critic/boxes/DR/terminations UNCHANGED, so a
    V2 or HitterPure checkpoint warm-resumes STRICTLY; the hold is a new STATE distribution the warm
    start must adapt to, expect a value-refit dip):
      * motion.hold_steps_range (0,0) → (25,125): the 0.5-2.5 s wait window @50 Hz (inside the deploy
        envelope; deliberately not longer — holds pay no goal income and dilute the strike batch).
      * hold_ready weight 0 → 1.0 (std 1.5 / reach 0.30 / station, include_ang_vel=False): settle-at-
        station income DURING the hold (planted feet × LINEAR stillness, in_hold-gated, pays only within
        0.30 m of the station). include_ang_vel=False drops the yaw-rate penalty so it does NOT fight the
        heading turn (see hold_heading below) — the fix for the RallyV3 conflict, letting this task settle
        AND re-square (RallyV3 had to pick one).
      * ARRIVAL-GATED RELEASE (racket.hold_until_settled): the hold EXTENDS past its [25,125] countdown
        while the base is not yet at the station (err>0.12 m) or still moving (>0.20 m/s), capped +100
        steps — so the swing arms only AFTER arrival ("到位才放行"), not on a fixed timer (the timer alone
        can release far/slow/disturbed swings before settling).
      * HEADING RECOVERY: hold_heading 1.0 (std 0.6) + yawed stand starts (±0.6) — re-square during the
        hold when entering yawed (deploy follow-through leaves 30-55°). Coexists with hold_ready via the
        include_ang_vel=False split above.
      * STREAMING PLANNER: midswing_resample_prob 0.05 — the target is refined mid-approach (paper Fig. 3),
        training "planner keeps commanding until contact" rather than one-target-per-swing.
      * WALKING POSTURE: foot_orientation -0.3 (177-proven pigeon-toe fix) — quiets the moving-gait toe-in
        (hip_yaw/roll + ankle_roll toward the reference footwork). ⚠ lower-body reward → gate on AGI G3.
      * post_strike_brake stays 0.0 — GAE precision-killer (0.994→0.866 on model_18000/rally2).

         is what makes "stay if reachable" POSSIBLE: nearby balls are returned by arm extension
         from the CURRENT stance; only balls outside it warrant a station step.
      2. MOSTLY-STATIONARY STATION MIXTURE (user intent 2026-07-11: movement only when it buys
         return quality, most balls taken in place): 50% same station / 20% 3-12 cm adjust /
         30% 12-35 cm real step (also closes the old 12-20 cm sampling hole), explicit planner
         side. base_position pays for being AT the commanded station — a "same" command earns
         it by standing still, so movement is command-selected, never rewarded per se.
      3. LONG-HOLD TAIL (hold_long_prob 0.15 → U[150,300] steps): deploy active-idle windows run
         4-7 s; the rallyv2-generation G3 blocker was instability in exactly those windows that
         the base [25,125] hold range never covers.
      4. YAW RAMP (stand_start_yaw_ramp_steps): the ±0.6 heading-recovery band ramps in from 0
         over ~4000 iters — a fresh run starting at the full band never converges its heading
         (V6 regression), and the manual fix was staged resumes.
      5. hold_ready 1.0 with include_ang_vel=True + heading_gate 0.25: the idle-feet prescription
         from the V4/V5 A/B — V4 (no hold_ready) still had intermittent foot convulsions, V5's
         include_ang_vel=False let the base spin 0.69 rad/s in holds; the near-square gate pays
         FULL stillness (linear+angular+feet) only after the hold_heading turn is done, so the
         two incomes never fight. Hold clocks stay exogenous (hold_until_settled=False) so the
         positive in-hold income is un-farmable (the brake post-mortem invariant).
      6. NO backhand clearance terms: the v7 backhand's measured blade↔left-hand minimum is
         0.574 m (receipt) — the hopex-era barrier is unnecessary.
      7. Fresh-only (train.py guard): warm-resume entropy/value-refit illusions were a recurring
         diagnosis sink, and a fresh run inherits the pldamp-folded plant alignment the old
         champions predate.
      8. FOOT DISCIPLINE while stepping (user 2026-07-11: no ankle-rolling/崴脚 during moves):
         rally_ankle_qdes_saturation −0.20 (FinalV2-proven raw pre-clamp ankle-roll q_des
         debt — the ankle-rail commands ARE the visible ankle-roll artifact) on top of the
         inherited foot_orientation −0.8 (swing-phase ankle/hip posture vs reference) and
         hold_ready's planted-feet stillness income.

    Inherits V4 unchanged: strike block 14/14/5 + base_position 2.0/0.20, x-lock station,
    hold_heading 1.0/std 0.6, foot_orientation −0.8 hold-gated, x-drift trio 2.0/1.0/−0.02,
    brake 0, plant 0, DeployParity terminations, DR ±15%. Gate ladder: G1 det (eval_deterministic
    task=HOPEPingPongHitterPureRallyV8, composite ≥0.95 / bh ≥0.93 / pre_fall ≤2%) → G2.5 →

# (110-D hitter_pure actor contract, independent station sampling, fixed striking PLANE, strike phase /
# window, per-clip velocity/normal boxes, DR, terminations, x-LOCK base_target_x [0,0], base_position_std
# 0.20 — NOT widened to 0.35, NO hold_steps, NO base_station_settle / post_strike_brake / lower_body_plant
# / midswing). A HitterPure checkpoint warm-resumes STRICTLY (obs/critic/boxes unchanged).
#
# Problem targeted: on a SINGLE swing the base is still translating or turning when the swing arms, so the
# robot enters the hit carrying base xy velocity / yaw-rate → foot slip + odd compensation. Four small,
# narrowly-gated reward additions (all deploy-honest — IMU-measurable base state only, NO actor obs change):
#   1. backhand_left_hand_clearance −2.0 (margin 0.15) — the bh windup must not sweep the paddle through
#      the left hand (Isaac self-collision OFF hides it; AGI MuJoCo reveals it). Backhand-clip-only, 0 when
#      clear. (Already declared inert in HOPEHitterPureRewardsCfg; enabled here.)
#   2. pre_strike_base_vel_quiet −0.05 (std 0.20) — quiet base planar velocity pre-strike; gate
#      (t_min<tts<t_max) & ~strike_window ⇒ effective 0.12–0.30 s (strike window itself excluded).
#   3. pre_strike_base_angvel_quiet −0.05 (std 0.30) — quiet base YAW-RATE, same effective window.
#   4. strike_heading +0.5 (std 0.35, window 0.15 s) — face square (heading→+x) AT the strike.
# Terms 2–3 are BOUNDED gentle nudges (1−exp kernels) that can never out-vote the racket strike terms;
# term 4 is a small positive facing reward only around contact. See hope_rewards.py for the full rationale.
