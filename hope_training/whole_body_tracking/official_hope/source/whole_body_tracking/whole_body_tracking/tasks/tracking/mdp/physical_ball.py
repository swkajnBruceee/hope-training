"""PHYSICAL ball + table for the tracking task — Phase A/B TRUTH INSTRUMENT (metrics only).

WHAT THIS IS: a flag-gated (``RacketTargetCommandCfg.physical_ball`` /
task racket config / task-YAML ``racket.physical_ball``) real PhysX rigid-body ball, one per env,
plus a visual-only table USD, that realizes each swing's question-bank incoming ball physically.
Neither asset has a PhysX contact path to the robot:

* SERVE — when the per-swing question is known (bank resample) and ``time_to_strike`` enters the
  serve horizon, the ball is launched from the venue-model REVERSE-TIME integrated state
  (:func:`back_integrate_incoming`: RK4 of the fitted flight law with a negative step, TRUNCATED
  at the table plane — the FINAL BALLISTIC SEGMENT only), ``tts_effective`` seconds before the
  strike, so that forward flight arrives at the question's contact point with the question's
  incoming velocity exactly at the exact-strike frame.
* FLIGHT — PhysX gravity + the per-physics-substep venue aero wrench (drag + Magnus,
  ``F = m(-k_d|v|v + k_m omega x v)``, world->body rotated because Isaac Lab 2.1
  ``set_external_force_and_torque`` applies wrenches in the BODY frame — the
  table_tennis_env.py / shadow_ball.py mechanism, re-used verbatim).
* TABLE BOUNCE — CODE-DRIVEN: a descending crossing of ``surface_z + R`` inside the table
  footprint triggers :func:`predict_table_contact` (the fitted angle-dependent tangential-impulse
  contact with the VENUE TABLE params ``contact.table`` of configs/ball_physics_venue.yaml:
  constant e_eff, v_r = 0, n = +z). PhysX NEVER resolves the ball's contacts (see below), so the
  fitted model is the single bounce authority — no restitution double-count.
* RACKET IMPULSE (PHASE B, ``physical_ball_impulse=True``) — CODE-DRIVEN, like the table bounce:
  each physics substep the manager reads the blade pose through the command's PURE FK helper
  (``RacketTargetCommand._racket_fk`` — the same math ``_compute_racket_state`` assigns from,
  returned as LOCALS; blade-center contact-point velocity incl. omega x mount-offset; no fourth
  FK derivation). The command's reward/obs-visible buffers ``racket_pos_w`` / ``racket_quat_w`` /
  ``racket_lin_vel_w`` / ``racket_normal_w`` are NEVER written from the substep path: Isaac Lab
  2.1 runs reward_manager BEFORE command_manager.compute, so a substep rebind would leak
  mid-step-fresh FK into the reward stream and break the metrics-only contract
  (adversarial-review fix; tensor-identity regression-tested). The scan runs
  :func:`blade_disc_contact`:
  a disc of radius ``RACKET_CONTACT_RADIUS`` (0.075 m — hope_planner.constants.racket_radius ==
  table_tennis_env.RACKET_CONTACT_RADIUS) at the blade pose, slab test |d_n| <= R + pad OR a
  blade-plane SIGN CROSSING between substeps (the anti-tunnel test — at 200 Hz physics and up to
  ~10 m/s closing speed the slab alone can be jumped), plus the table_tennis approaching test.
  On detection :func:`racket_impulse` — a PURE DELEGATION to
  ``virtual_ball.predict_paddle_contact`` (the venue e(u_n) paddle model; NO fourth contact
  implementation) — rewrites the ball's velocity+spin via ``write_root_velocity_to_sim`` (WORLD
  frame; the aero wrench path stays body-frame per Isaac Lab 2.1) AND SNAPS the ball to the
  blade-PLANE contact point via ``write_root_pose_to_sim`` (the table-bounce snap mirrored:
  interpolated plane crossing on the crossing branch, normal projection on the slab branch —
  d_n = 0, the vb channel's blade-plane convention, so the return flight and the analytic vb
  rollout launch from one convention and ``pb_virt_phys_gap_m`` measures channel divergence,
  not detection-sampling offset). ONE impulse per swing
  (``_impulse_done`` latch, re-armed only by ``on_resample``). The struck ball's RETURN flight
  is then measured: first descending ``surface+R`` crossing = ``pb_return_land_x/y`` (+ error vs
  the question's latched landing target (the current tuple's ``intended_landing_xy`` for the
  permanent FH/BH physical cohorts and V14 ``vb_target_x/y`` for core), net-plane crossing at
  ``near_x + NET_X`` with clearance ``center >
  surface + NET_HEIGHT + R`` (the same constants as virtual_ball/hope_commands), return-flight
  table bounces in ``pb_return_bounce_count`` (SPLIT from the Phase A pre-strike honesty counter
  ``pb_bounce_count``, which stays ~0-meaningful), and THE
  cross-ruler ``pb_virt_phys_gap_m`` = |physical return landing - the analytic vb landing
  prediction latched for the SAME strike| (virtual channel vs engine channel divergence — the
  instrument's whole point).
* ROBOT PASS-THROUGH — the ball's collider is DISABLED (``collision_enabled=False``), which
  filters ball<->robot AND ball<->table PhysX contacts in one switch. This is deliberate:
  (a) the racket contact is CODE-DRIVEN even in Phase B (the fitted venue paddle model — a PhysX
  robot collision would be an unfitted artifact double-hitting on top of it); (b) the table
  bounce must be code-authoritative anyway (PhysX restitution cannot represent the fitted
  spin-dependent contact). The table USD is visual-only and contains no PhysX collider. Phase B
  COLLISION-FILTER DECISION (recorded): code is the single contact
  authority for ball<->robot AND ball<->table, so the required per-pair filter set is ALL of the
  ball's pairs — which is exactly what the one-switch disabled collider expresses. Isaac Lab 2.1
  spawn cfgs cannot express PhysX filtered pairs (``UsdPhysics.FilteredPairsAPI``) per pair, and
  the only CCD knob is the SCENE-level ``sim.physx.enable_ccd`` (no per-body field in this
  version, per table_tennis_env_cfg) — with every ball pair filtered CCD would arm NOTHING while
  still touching the robot's solver path, so the collider stays OFF and CCD is SKIPPED (loud
  print at init). Anti-tunnel duty is carried by the blade-plane sign-crossing test above and by
  the segment-based table-plane crossing scan. NO ball<->anything PhysX contact is ever enabled
  silently.

PHYSICS BASIS: scripts/isaac_ball_inloop_check.py validated exactly this injection pattern
(batched single view, per-substep body-frame venue aero wrench) with an in-loop result of PhysX
flight matching the venue RK4 reference to a 17 mm SYSTEMATIC landing offset — that number is the
expected floor for ``pb_serve_err_m`` here (reverse-RK4 launch -> forward PhysX-Euler flight).

WHAT THIS IS NOT: a TRUTH INSTRUMENT only. Reward and observation streams are COMPLETELY
untouched even when the flag is on — no reward term, no obs term, no bank-target logic reads any
of this; the analytic virtual ball (:mod:`virtual_ball`) remains the reward machine. The value is
per-strike ground truth: ``pb_serve_err_m`` / ``pb_serve_vel_err`` measure how exactly the engine
delivers the question's (contact point, incoming velocity) at the strike frame, and the
post-strike flight/bounce/landing metrics record what the real ball did.

HONESTY NOTES (read before trusting the numbers):

* Phase A serves ONLY the FINAL BALLISTIC SEGMENT (post-last-bounce): the reverse integration
  TRUNCATES at the table plane (last state strictly above ``surface_z + R + SERVE_PLANE_MARGIN``)
  and returns the per-env ``tts_effective`` it actually covered. Questions whose real history
  includes the incoming table bounce (rising contact velocities — ~11% of the bank — and moderate
  tts generally) launch LATER, ``tts_effective`` before the strike, from ON the incoming
  trajectory, so forward flight for ``tts_effective`` still arrives exactly at the question
  (contact, velocity) — the arrival guarantee the instrument needs. The pre-bounce segment is
  OUT OF SCOPE until the bounce-aware serve (bounce-map inversion — future work). This fix is
  the seed=1 pod-defect root cause: un-truncated back-integration put rising-contact launches
  under/inside the table (pb_serve_err_m 0.58 m); seed=0 had merely been lucky with questions.
* With ``physical_ball_impulse=False`` (default) the strike applies NO impulse (Phase A
  behavior, byte-identical): the ball flies THROUGH the strike point and the robot, descends
  behind it, and its first descending ``surface+R`` crossing is recorded as the landing (same
  plane convention as virtual_ball.coarse_landing / the shadow ball). With the impulse ON, a
  swing whose blade physically contacts the ball BEFORE the exact-strike frame consumes that
  swing's serve measurement (the inbound arrival is no longer measurable — the hit is counted in
  ``pb_hit_count`` instead), and a swing whose blade never meets the ball keeps the Phase A
  pass-through landing path.
* SUBSTEP KNOB (``physical_ball_substep``, default 1 = OFF — decision CLOSED for S1: the venue
  band passed in-loop at 17 mm without it; the knob exists for S3 fast balls): >1 integrates the
  venue flight law with N Euler substeps INSIDE each physics callback and applies the
  velocity-matched average aero force (:func:`substepped_aero_force`). APPROXIMATION, stated
  honestly: only the VELOCITY update is substep-corrected — PhysX still integrates the position
  with one constant acceleration over its own dt (true substepping needs a smaller sim-level
  dt), so per-step position curvature error remains first-order. N=1 reduces EXACTLY to
  ``shadow_ball.venue_aero_force`` (tested), so the default is byte-identical to Phase A.
* The pre-strike arc cannot trigger the table bounce by construction (the bounce fires only on
  DESCENDING in-bounds crossings; the inbound arc's minimum over the table is the contact point
  itself, which sits above ``surface+R``). If an out-of-envelope question ever does descend
  through the plane in-bounds pre-strike, the bounce is applied anyway (physical consistency) and
  ``pb_serve_err_m`` reports the damage honestly. ``pb_bounce_count`` counts ONLY non-RETURN-mode
  bounces so this "~0 by construction" honesty meaning survives Phase B: successful returns
  land and re-bounce on the table by design, and those go to ``pb_return_bounce_count`` instead
  (adversarial-review fix — pre-split, impulse-on runs read pb_bounce_count ~ 1-2x
  pb_return_count and the invariant silently inverted).

    cases).

    WHY TRUNCATE (seed=1 pod defect): for rising contact velocities (vz >= 0) and moderate tts
    the pure backward path dips below the table plane — in reality that segment is PRE-BOUNCE —
    and an un-truncated launch sat under/inside the table (pb_serve_err_m 0.58 m). Phase A
    serves only the FINAL BALLISTIC SEGMENT (post-last-bounce); realizing the pre-bounce segment
    (bounce-map inversion) is the future bounce-aware serve. ``tts_effective`` runs ~0.14-0.35 s
    for typical bank contact heights — the serve simply fires later.

    Vectorized over envs with PER-ENV step size: ``n = ceil(max(tts)/h)`` fixed-length loop,
    ``h_i = tts_i / n`` (envs with smaller tts get a smaller, MORE accurate step; ``tts_i = 0``
    rows take identity steps); a row that would step below the plane (or past the speed cap)
    rejects that step and freezes, so ``tts_effective`` is an exact multiple of its ``h_i``.
    Frame-free in xy; ``surface_z`` must be given in the SAME frame as ``contact_pos`` (env-local
    ``vb_table_surface_z`` when positions are env-local, or origin-shifted when world — the
    tracking env grids are z-flat so the manager passes world contact points with the env-local
    plane unchanged). Omega is constant in flight (the fit's assumption).

        snapped back to the plane at the interpolated crossing point). The first POST-strike
        crossing (in-bounds or not — the shadow/vb landing-plane convention) is recorded as the
        landing. Pre-strike in-bounds crossings bounce too (physical consistency; see module
        docstring — cannot occur for in-envelope questions).

        BOUNCE COUNTING IS MODE-SPLIT (adversarial-review fix): every in-bounds crossing still
        takes the physical bounce, but only non-RETURN crossings latch ``_bounce_new`` (the Phase
        A pre-strike honesty counter, ~0 by construction) while RETURN-flight crossings latch
        ``_ret_bounce_new`` -> ``pb_return_bounce_count`` (returns legitimately bounce on the
        opponent half — without the split they dominated pb_bounce_count and inverted its
        invariant).

        HOT-PATH SYNC DISCIPLINE: the idle early-out uses the host-side ``_active_host`` counter
        (control-rate maintained, over-estimate-only — see update()) and all event LATCHES are
        branchless masked writes; the only per-substep ``bool()`` host sync left is the rare

        DETECTION RATE — physics substep (200 Hz), like the table bounce and the reference
        table_tennis_env._handle_paddle: at up to ~10 m/s ball-blade closing speed a 50 Hz
        control step moves ~20 cm (>> the 7.5 cm blade), so control-rate detection would miss
        most hits; at 5 ms substeps the motion is ~5 cm and the sign-crossing branch of
        :func:`blade_disc_contact` covers the remainder (no CCD needed — see the init print).

        BLADE STATE — the command's PURE FK helper (``RacketTargetCommand._racket_fk()``:
        articulation data is lazily refreshed against the sim timestamp, so the blade pose read
        here is substep-fresh) returns ``(pos, quat, lin_vel, raw_normal, signed_normal)`` as
        LOCALS — the same math as the reward path, NO fourth FK derivation, and NO write to the
        command's ``racket_pos_w`` / ``racket_quat_w`` / ``racket_lin_vel_w`` /
        ``racket_normal_raw_w`` / ``racket_normal_w`` buffers. This is load-bearing
        (adversarial-review fix): Isaac Lab 2.1 runs
        ``reward_manager.compute`` BEFORE ``command_manager.compute``, so a substep rebind of
        those buffers would feed the racket tracking rewards mid-step-fresh FK (~one control
        frame ahead of the flag-off baseline) — a metrics-only contract violation. Regression:
        all five attributes must stay the IDENTICAL tensor objects across this scan
        (test_physical_ball_helpers.test_substep_fk_scan_side_effect_free).

        the venue e(u_n) paddle model) on the ball's ENGINE state at the contact substep; the
        outgoing (v+, omega+) is written via ``write_root_velocity_to_sim`` (WORLD frame — the
        one frame trap: external wrenches are body-frame in Isaac Lab 2.1, root-velocity writes
        are world-frame) TOGETHER WITH the blade-plane contact-point snap via
        ``write_root_pose_to_sim`` (the table-bounce snap mirrored; adversarial-review fix — the
        detection sample can sit 2-5 cm past the plane on the crossing branch, and launching the
        return from there biased pb_return_land_* / pb_virt_phys_gap_m by that offset): crossing
        rows interpolate the substep fraction ``f = prev_d_n / (prev_d_n - d_n)`` along the
        prev->current ball segment to the ``d_n = 0`` plane point (the vb channel's blade-plane
        convention — its rollout starts at racket_pos_w ON the plane); slab rows (no sign
