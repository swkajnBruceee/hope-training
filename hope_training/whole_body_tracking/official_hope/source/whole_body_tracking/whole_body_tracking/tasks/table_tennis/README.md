# HOPE Table-Tennis Match Environment (Isaac Lab)

A clean, modular Isaac Lab task that simulates a **standard table-tennis competition scene** — floor,
table, net (+ posts), a dynamic ITTF ball, and the **Agibot A3** humanoid — with realistic ball flight,
bounce, and racket/table contact. The table/net are invisible cuboid colliders overlaid with a
**realistic USD mesh** for visuals (see [Table visuals](#table-visuals-usd-overlay)). Built as a
manager-based `ManagerBasedRLEnv` so RL training can be layered on later; the first goal here is a
**correct physics + visualization scene**.

Gym id: **`HOPE-TableTennis-AgibotA3-v0`**

## Coordinate frame (canonical HOPE frame, used everywhere)

The simulation world frame **is** the HOPE frame (ROS 2 REP-103), identical to the planner / mocap docs
and `hope_ws/.../hope_world_frame.yaml`:

| Axis | Direction | Range on the table |
|------|-----------|--------------------|
| **X** | toward Player Two (P2), along the table length | `0 → +2.74 m` |
| **Y** | left, from P1's perspective, along the table width | `0 → −1.525 m` |
| **Z** | up; **z = 0 is the table surface** | floor at `z = −0.76 m` |

Origin = the **near-side left corner of the table surface** (P1 perspective). Each parallel environment
is an independent court whose local origin coincides with this HOPE origin, so an asset's
environment-local position *is* its HOPE-frame position. Landmarks (net center `(1.37, −0.7625, 0)`,
P1/P2 half centers, floor at `−0.76`) all match the reference docs — see [`geometry.py`](geometry.py),
which is the single source of truth and is regression-tested against the ITTF/HOPE constants in
`tests/test_table_tennis_geometry.py`.

## How to run (visualization, no policy)

This needs Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab, which live in the **`grasping` distrobox**. The launcher
`hope_isaac_py` (defined by `setup_train_env.sh`) runs Isaac's bundled Python with the working-tree
PYTHONPATH, so your local edits to this task win:

```bash
distrobox enter grasping
cd /path/to/your/clone/hope_training/whole_body_tracking
source setup_train_env.sh                          # defines hope_isaac_py + sets PYTHONPATH

hope_isaac_py scripts/play_table_tennis.py                 # 1 court, robot free-standing, drag OFF (Purdue parity)
hope_isaac_py scripts/play_table_tennis.py --num_envs 9    # 9 courts
hope_isaac_py scripts/play_table_tennis.py --fix_base      # pin the pelvis (stable view; no balance policy yet)
hope_isaac_py scripts/play_table_tennis.py --enable_aero   # turn ON the HOPE-calibrated air-drag model
hope_isaac_py scripts/play_table_tennis.py --magnus 0.1    # enable Magnus (spin) lift + serve spin (implies --enable_aero)
hope_isaac_py scripts/play_table_tennis.py --headless --steps 300   # no-GUI smoke run (loads + steps)
```

Each reset serves a ball from over the P2 half toward the P1-side robot; you should see it arc, bounce on
the table (effective normal restitution ≈ `0.9 × 0.95 = 0.855`), and continue toward the robot. The robot
holds its default standing pose (zero action). The console prints `ball aerodynamics active: True/False`
so you can confirm whether the drag callback registered (off unless `--enable_aero` / `--magnus`).

Notes:
* **First launch is slow** — `UrdfFileCfg` converts the A3 URDF → USD once, then caches it.
* **Without `--fix_base` the robot may drift/topple** after a few seconds (there is no balance/return
  controller yet — that is the RL follow-up). Use `--fix_base` for a stable view of the ball physics.

## Physics model

* **Gravity + all rigid-body contacts** (ball↔table / net / floor / racket) are handled natively by
  PhysX, with per-surface contact materials defined in `geometry.BounceMaterials`. Material values follow
  **Purdue PACE**: ball `restitution 0.9 / friction 0.1`, table `0.95 / 0.4`, ball mass `3.4 g`. Combine
  mode is `multiply`, so effective ball↔table normal restitution is `0.9 × 0.95 = 0.855`. Unlike Purdue
  (one bouncy material for the whole table+net), we keep a **separate low-restitution net** (`0.1`) so the
  ball dies on a net touch — more correct for match play.
* **Aerodynamic drag** is the one thing PhysX cannot model for a 40 mm ball. It is **off by default** to
  match Purdue PACE (PhysX-only flight); turn it on with `--enable_aero` (or `ball_aerodynamics.enabled =
  True`). When on, it is added every physics substep (400 Hz) by `TableTennisEnv` via a physics-step
  callback, using the HOPE-calibrated model `a_drag = −k|v|v` (`k = 0.5 s/m`, matching
  `hope_planner.constants.BallPhysics`). See [`ball.py`](ball.py). **Magnus (spin) lift** is provided but
  off unless `--magnus` / `ball_aerodynamics.magnus_coefficient` is set.
* Physics runs at **400 Hz** (`sim.dt = 0.0025`), control at **100 Hz** (`decimation = 4`). The high
  physics rate keeps the small, fast ball from tunnelling through the thin racket blade / net.

| Scene assets (one `build_*` helper per prim) + MDP managers | [`table_tennis_env_cfg.py`](table_tennis_env_cfg.py) |
| Per-substep force application / env class | [`table_tennis_env.py`](table_tennis_env.py) |

### Table visuals (USD overlay)

The table / net / posts / center line are kept as **invisible cuboid colliders** (`visible=False`) that
own all bounce physics, and a realistic **USD mesh** (Purdue PACE, ICRA 2026, MIT — see
[`table_usd/LICENSE-PACE-ICRA2026-MIT.txt`](table_usd/LICENSE-PACE-ICRA2026-MIT.txt)) is overlaid for
looks via `build_table_usd_visual_cfg` (`scene.table_visual`). Only the USD's
*base* geometry layer is referenced, which carries **no PhysX colliders**, so physics is unchanged. The
USD frame is aligned to the HOPE frame by translating its local origin to
`(TABLE_LENGTH/2, −TABLE_WIDTH/2, FLOOR_Z)` (floor at its local z = 0, surface at 0.76, net top 0.9125).
The USD is ~1.76 m wide vs the ITTF/cuboid 1.525 m, so the visual table is slightly wider than its
collider — cosmetic only. To go back to plain boxes, drop `table_visual` and flip the cuboids'
`visible=False` back to `True`; for memory-tight headless training set `scene.table_visual = None`.

To add a second robot (P2), add an articulation to the scene cfg. To add real match rewards
(return-over-net, landing in the opponent half, racket-to-ball tracking), add terms in `RewardsCfg` /
`mdp/rewards.py`.

## Known limitations / calibration TODOs

These are first-pass defaults chosen for a visibly correct scene; they need an in-sim calibration pass
(the PhysX analogue of `hope_planner.calibrate_ball_physics`). All knobs live in `geometry.py` /
`ball.py` so calibration touches one place:

1. **Material choice vs. the HOPE planner**: bounce materials now follow **Purdue PACE** (effective
   ball↔table normal restitution `0.855`, ball friction `0.1`), not the planner's calibrated
   `C_v = 0.85` / `C_h = 0.75` / `C_r = 0.88`. Tangential (horizontal) loss is governed by PhysX
   friction rather than a restitution coefficient, and the racket inherits the robot's contact material.
   Reconciling the Purdue materials with the planner's `C_h` / `C_r` is a calibration TODO. Likewise the
   ball is **3.4 g (Purdue)** with **air drag off by default**, vs. the planner's 2.7 g + drag model —
   re-enable drag with `--enable_aero` if you want planner-consistent flight.
2. **Robot facing**: the A3 is spawned with identity orientation (assumed +X-forward). If the URDF
   forward axis is −X, flip `init_state.rot` in `config/agibot_a3/table_tennis_env_cfg.py`.
3. **Balance**: there is no balance/return policy yet, so the free-standing robot may drift/topple over
   several seconds — use `--fix_base` for a stable visualization. A returner policy is the RL follow-up.
4. **Very fast smashes** (≫ 8 m/s) may still need PhysX CCD on the ball to avoid tunnelling through the
   2.9 mm racket blade; the 400 Hz physics rate covers normal serve/rally speeds.

## Verification status

* `tests/test_table_tennis_geometry.py` (frame/geometry + drag/Magnus math) — **passing** on a plain
  Python host (drag/Magnus tests auto-skip if `torch` is missing).
* All modules pass `py_compile`.
* **In-sim runtime** (asset spawn, contacts, the aero callback, robot stand) must be verified inside the
  Isaac Lab environment with `scripts/play_table_tennis.py` — it has not been run on a host without
  Isaac Sim.
