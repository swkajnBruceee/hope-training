"""Canonical HOPE table-tennis geometry, expressed in the HOPE world frame.

The HOPE world frame (ROS 2 REP-103, identical to the planner / mocap reference docs):

* **Origin** — the near-side **left** corner of the table *surface*, from Player One's (P1) perspective.
* **X** — forward, toward Player Two (P2), along the table length:  ``x in [0, 2.74] m``.
* **Y** — left, from P1's perspective, along the table width:        ``y in [-1.525, 0] m``.
* **Z** — up; **z = 0 is the table surface** (the floor is therefore at ``z = -0.76 m``).

Key landmarks (see ``mocap/HOPE_Motion_Capture_System_and_Coordinates_Reference_Setup.md`` §2.1
and ``hope_ws/.../hope_world_frame.yaml``)::

    Origin (P1 near-side left corner)   ( 0.0  ,  0.0   ,  0.0 )
    Net center line                     ( 1.37 , -0.7625,  0.0 )
    P1 half center                      ( 0.685, -0.7625,  0.0 )
    P2 half center                      ( 2.055, -0.7625,  0.0 )
    Floor directly below origin         ( 0.0  ,  0.0   , -0.76)

This module is the **single source of truth** for the geometry used to build the Isaac Lab scene.
It is pure Python (no Isaac / torch imports) so it can be imported anywhere and unit-tested without a
simulator. The numbers mirror ``hope_ws/src/hope_planner/hope_planner/constants.py`` (ITTF regulation
table) so the simulator and the model-based planner share one consistent world.

The simulation world frame is set **equal to** this HOPE frame: each environment's local origin sits
at the table-surface height (HOPE z = 0), so an asset's environment-local position *is* its HOPE-frame
position. With multiple environments, every environment is an independent court with its own HOPE
origin anchored at that environment's origin.

    The ball and table values follow the **Purdue PACE** model
    (``legged_lab/assets/table_tennis/{ball,table}.py``): table ``restitution = 0.95`` / ``friction = 0.4``
    and ball ``restitution = 0.9`` / ``friction = 0.1``.

    NOTE on combine modes: every material here is created with ``*_combine_mode="multiply"`` (see
    ``table_tennis_env_cfg._surface_material``), so the *effective* coefficient of a ball<->surface
    contact is the **product** of the two materials' values. That product is what lets the net kill the
    ball. Effective ball<->surface **normal restitutions** are therefore:

        table  0.9 * 0.95 = 0.855      floor  0.9 * 0.4 = 0.36      net  0.9 * 0.1 = 0.09

    (Purdue itself uses a single material for the whole table+net under PhysX-default averaging, so in
    their sim the ball *bounces* off the net. We keep multiply + a separate low-restitution net so the
    ball still dies on a net touch — more correct for match play. Adopting Purdue's net behavior would
    mean raising ``net_restitution`` to 0.95.)

    Friction is likewise multiplicative; with the low Purdue ball friction (0.1) the tangential
    (horizontal) bounce is light. Exact horizontal-/racket-restitution matching to the HOPE planner
    (``C_h = 0.75`` / ``C_r = 0.88``) remains a calibration TODO. All knobs live here so a calibration
    pass only edits this one place.
