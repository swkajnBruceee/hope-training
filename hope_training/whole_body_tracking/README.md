## HOPE Agibot A3 Ping-Pong (this repo)

Status: Partial — A3 training here demonstrates pipeline viability, NOT an accepted quality baseline.

This package is the BeyondMimic motion-tracking trainer (upstream G1 docs below), extended in HOPE
to train an [Agibot A3](../../agibot/) (31 actuated DOF) ping-pong swing policy. Unlike the upstream
`argparse` entry (`scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0`), HOPE drives training through
**Hydra** entry points:

- `scripts/train.py` and `scripts/play.py` with `task=HOPEPingPong algo=ppo`.
- The `HOPEPingPong` task maps to the gym task `HOPE-PingPong-AgibotA3-v0` (`experiment_name agibot_a3_hope`).
- Overrides are layered from the `cfg/` tree: `cfg/task` (env/task), `cfg/algo` (PPO), `cfg/base` (shared defaults).
- Each policy trains **ONE swing style** (forehand or backhand), selected by the local `motion_file`
  or optional `registry_name`.
- A plain tracking smoke test with no WandB is `task=TrackingFlat algo=ppo`; see
  `../../QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md`.

**The public starter runbook is [QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md](../../QUICKSTART_A3_ISAAC.md).**
A from-scratch Isaac Sim/Lab install is out of scope here; follow the upstream
[Isaac Lab installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).

### HOPE environment (GPU/Isaac box)

- Isaac Sim 4.5.0, Isaac Lab 2.1.0, Python 3.10, NVIDIA CUDA GPU; `rsl_rl` comes via Isaac Lab.
- Install into the Isaac Lab python: `python -m pip install -e training`.
- Extra pip deps must be importable in the Isaac Lab python: `hydra`, `omegaconf`, `onnxscript`,
  and `psutil`. Install `wandb` only if you use WandB logging or a motion registry.
- `source setup_train_env.sh` (must be **sourced**, in the GPU/Isaac shell) to get the `hope_isaac_py`
  launcher. Edit its site-specific paths, or provide a git-ignored
  `setup_train_env.local.sh` override that it auto-sources.

### A3 asset and motions

- The source A3 ping-pong URDF lives at `../../agibot/URDF/A3T2.5-URDF-std-pingpang/`.
  Generate the Isaac-ready copy with `../../scripts/prepare_a3_isaac_asset.py`; see
  `../../A3_ASSETS.md`.
- Motion flow: GVHMR (video → SMPL-X) → GMR (`--robot agibot_a3`; the default robot is `g1`, A3 NEEDS
  `--robot agibot_a3`) → `scripts/csv_to_npz.py --robot agibot_a3` → local `motion_file=...`.
  Uploading to your own WandB "Motions" registry is optional.
- `scripts/create_smoke_motion.py` creates a local stand-still `.npz` for smoke training.
- If you use WandB, set `WANDB_ENTITY` for run logging and `WANDB_REGISTRY_ORG` for motion registry
  access. The public quickstart does not require either value.
- `HOPEPingPong.yaml` defaults to `target_mode: reference_perturbed`: the racket target is sampled
  around the reference motion's strike-frame racket state with a widening perturbation curriculum.
  The legacy uniform target ranges are still placeholders and should only be used after IK validation
  against A3 right-arm reachability; an unreachable target caps `strike_success` regardless of reward tuning.
- `max_iterations` defaults to 30000 for real runs. The public quickstart passes
  `max_iterations=3` explicitly for smoke training.

## Overview

BeyondMimic is a versatile humanoid control framework that provides highly dynamic motion tracking with the
state-of-the-art motion quality on real-world deployment and steerable test-time control with guided diffusion-based
controllers.

This repo covers the motion tracking training in BeyondMimic. **You should be able to
train any sim-to-real-ready motion in the LAFAN1 dataset, without tuning any parameters**.

For sim-to-sim and sim-to-real deployment, please refer to
the [motion_tracking_controller](https://github.com/HybridRobotics/motion_tracking_controller).

### Alternative Implementations

- There is an alternative reproduction of BeyondMimic in [mjlab](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab), a new Isaac Lab-style manager API powered by MuJoCo-Warp for RL and robotics research. See the implementation [here](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/blob/main/src/mjlab/tasks/tracking/tracking_env_cfg.py).

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab v2.1.0 by following
  the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html). We recommend
  using the conda installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

- Clone this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e., outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

```bash
# Option 1: SSH
git clone git@github.com:HybridRobotics/whole_body_tracking.git

# Option 2: HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/HybridRobotics/whole_body_tracking.git
```

- Pull the robot description files from GCS

```bash
# Enter the repository
cd whole_body_tracking
# Rename all occurrences of whole_body_tracking (in files/directories) to your_fancy_extension_name
curl -L -o unitree_description.tar.gz https://storage.googleapis.com/qiayuanl_robot_descriptions/unitree_description.tar.gz && \
tar -xzf unitree_description.tar.gz -C training/assets/ && \
rm unitree_description.tar.gz
```

- Using a Python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library

```bash
python -m pip install -e training
```

## Motion Tracking

### Motion Preprocessing & Registry Setup

In order to manage the large set of motions we used in this work, we leverage the WandB registry to store and load
reference motions automatically.
Note: The reference motion should be retargeted and use generalized coordinates only.

- Gather the reference motion datasets (please follow the original licenses), we use the same convention as .csv of
  Unitree's dataset

    - Unitree-retargeted LAFAN1 Dataset is available
      on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lvhaidong/LAFAN1_Retargeting_Dataset)
    - Sidekicks are from [KungfuBot](https://kungfu-bot.github.io/)
    - Christiano Ronaldo celebration is from [ASAP](https://github.com/LeCAR-Lab/ASAP).
    - Balance motions are from [HuB](https://hub-robot.github.io/)


- Optional: if you want WandB motion-registry uploads, log in to your WandB account; access Registry under Core on the
  left and create a registry collection named "Motions" with artifact type "All Types".


- Convert retargeted motions to include the maximum coordinates information (body pose, body velocity, and body
  acceleration) via forward kinematics,

```bash
python scripts/csv_to_npz.py --input_file {motion_name}.csv --input_fps 30 \
  --output_file sample_motions/{motion_name}.npz --headless
```

This saves a local NPZ for `motion_file=...` training. Add `--upload_wandb --output_name {motion_name}` only if your
team wants to upload the processed motion file to a WandB registry.

- Test if the WandB registry works properly by replaying the motion in Isaac Sim:

```bash
python scripts/replay_npz.py --registry_name={your-organization}-org/wandb-registry-motions/{motion_name}
```

- WandB debugging
    - Make sure to export WANDB_ENTITY to your organization name, not your personal username.

### Policy Training

- Train policy by the following command:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
--registry_name {your-organization}-org/wandb-registry-motions/{motion_name} \
--headless --logger wandb --log_project_name {project_name} --run_name {run_name}
```

### Policy Evaluation

- Play the trained policy by the following command:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 --num_envs=2 --wandb_path={wandb-run-path}
```

The WandB run path can be located in the run overview. It follows the format {your_organization}/{project_name}/ along
with a unique 8-character identifier. Note that run_name is different from run_path.

## Code Structure

Below is an overview of the code structure for this repository:

- **`training/tasks/tracking/mdp`**
  This directory contains the atomic functions to define the MDP for BeyondMimic. Below is a breakdown of the functions:

    - **`commands.py`**
      Command library to compute relevant variables from the reference motion, current robot state, and error
      computations. This includes pose and velocity error calculation, initial state randomization, and adaptive
      sampling.

    - **`rewards.py`**
      Implements the DeepMimic reward functions and smoothing terms.

    - **`events.py`**
      Implements domain randomization terms.

    - **`observations.py`**
      Implements observation terms for motion tracking and data collection.

    - **`terminations.py`**
      Implements early terminations and timeouts.

- **`training/tasks/tracking/tracking_env_cfg.py`**
  Contains the environment (MDP) hyperparameters configuration for the tracking task.

- **`training/tasks/tracking/config/g1/agents/rsl_rl_ppo_cfg.py`**
  Contains the PPO hyperparameters for the tracking task.

- **`training/robots`**
